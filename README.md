# Flying - Airline Routes

Flying is a React project used to display sample airline data with real-time
filtering capabilities.

You can click any airport on the maps to see all flights to and from that
airport.

Selecting an airline or airport below will provide instant updates on the map
and in the options that are able to be selected.
